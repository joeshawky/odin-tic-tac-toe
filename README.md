# Tic Tac Toe Game (Vanilla JS)

A browser-based Tic Tac Toe game created during the [JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) module of The Odin Project.

## üìê Features

- Clean and responsive UI using pure CSS
- Modular JavaScript logic with separation of concerns
